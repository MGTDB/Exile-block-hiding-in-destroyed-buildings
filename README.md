This is a script to block players from hiding in destroyed buildings in Arma 3 Exile
If a player goes prone and attempts to hide in a destroyed building, it will move them out of the ruins into the open

Edit the file paths, merge the files if needed.
If you cannot add this, you should probably go to the Exile Discord https://discord.gg/3pSqQKAHxK

Note, you don't need the image!
